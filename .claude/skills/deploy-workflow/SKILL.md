# Deploy Workflow

This skill defines the end-to-end workflow for creating, deploying, and managing apps on the Aperture infrastructure. Every deploy follows this pipeline. No shortcuts.

---

## 1. The Pipeline

```
Plan → Build → Push → Handoff → Deploy → Verify → Report
```

| Stage | Owner | What happens |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Plan** | Wheatley | Writes spec with scope, acceptance criteria, deploy details. Submits to GLaDOS. |
| **Approve** | GLaDOS | Reviews plan. Approves, requests changes, or rejects. |
| **Build** | GLaDOS (or subagent / specialist) | Scaffolds the app, writes code, creates Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml. |
| **Push** | Builder | Pushes to GitHub on `main` branch. Verifies branch exists with `git ls-remote`. |
| **Handoff** | Builder → Peppy | Sends structured deploy spec (see format below). |
| **Deploy** | Peppy | Creates Dokploy compose service, configures domain, triggers deploy via API. |
| **Verify** | Peppy | Confirms HTTPS is live, cert is valid, app responds. |
| **Report** | Peppy → GLaDOS → Operator | Reports live URL, compose ID, status. |

---

## 2. Role Responsibilities

**GLaDOS (Orchestrator)**
- Reviews and approves all plans before execution
- Decides execution strategy: code it herself, dispatch subagents via the Agent tool, or delegate to a specialist
- Handles scaffolding and code when appropriate
- Enforces quality gates and handoff standards
- Coordinates the full pipeline

**Wheatley (Planner/Researcher)**
- Writes specs and plans for new features/apps
- Researches technical approaches, APIs, libraries
- Submits plans as BEADS tasks pending GLaDOS approval
- Can handle small, well-scoped code tasks when delegated by GLaDOS

**Peppy (Infrastructure/Deployer)**
- Deploys apps via Dokploy API
- Manages server operations (SSH, Docker, monitoring)
- Runs pre-deploy checks (branch exists, compose valid)
- Verifies deploys are live with HTTPS
- Reports deployment status

**Izzy (Testing/QA)**
- Writes and runs tests
- Validates deployments post-launch
- Signs off on quality before a deploy is considered "done"

---

## 3. Deploy Handoff Format

**Every deploy handoff MUST include all five fields.** No deploy gets triggered without them.

```
**Deploy Spec:**
- Repo: <GitHub URL>
- Branch: main
- Service name: <exact key from docker-compose.yml>
- Port: <what the container listens on>
- Target subdomain: <name>.programaincluir.org
```

If the app requires a database, include a **Database** block:

```
**Database:**
- Engine: PostgreSQL 16
- Migration: <path/to/migration.sql>
- Internal host: <appName>:5432
- Env var: DATABASE_URL
```

Example full handoff:
```
**Deploy Spec:**
- Repo: https://github.com/FranciscoMateusVG/my-cool-app
- Branch: main
- Service name: my-cool-app-f7a3b2
- Port: 3000
- Target subdomain: my-cool-app.programaincluir.org

**Database:**
- Engine: PostgreSQL 16
- Migration: migrations/001_init.sql
- Internal host: my-cool-app-db:5432
- Env var: DATABASE_URL
```

**If any required field is missing, the deployer must ask before proceeding.**

### BEADS Task at Handoff

Before sending the handoff message, the builder **must** create a BEADS deploy task:

```
create_task(
  title: "Deploy <app-name> to <subdomain>.programaincluir.org",
  priority: 1,
  description: "Deploy spec: <paste deploy spec here>"
)
```

Assign it to Peppy so there's always an audit trail. The deploy is not officially tracked without a BEADS task.

---

## 4. Naming Conventions

### Compose service names
Every compose service uses the pattern: `<app-name>-<6char-hex-hash>`

Examples:
- `aperture-test-app-caa3a0`
- `my-cool-app-f7a3b2`
- `landing-page-9e2d1c`

This prevents container name collisions on the server. The hash is generated once at scaffold time and stays with the app forever.

### Branch convention
Always `main`. No `master`, no feature branches for production deploys.

### Subdomain convention
`<app-name>.programaincluir.org` — matches the app name, lowercase, hyphens for spaces.

---

## 5. Compose File Standard

Keep compose files **clean**. Dokploy manages all Traefik routing labels.

```yaml
services:
  <app-name>-<hash>:
    build: .
    container_name: <app-name>-<hash>
    restart: unless-stopped
```

**Do NOT include:**
- Traefik labels (Dokploy injects these)
- Port mappings (Dokploy handles this)
- Network definitions (Dokploy adds `dokploy-network`)

**Do include:**
- `build: .`
- `container_name:` matching the service name
- `restart: unless-stopped`
- Environment variables if needed (or use Dokploy's env management)

---

## 6. Pre-Deploy Checklist (Peppy)

Before triggering any deploy:

1. **Verify branch exists:** `git ls-remote <repo> refs/heads/main` — must return a SHA
2. **Confirm handoff is complete:** all five fields present
3. **Check for name collisions:** `docker ps --format '{{.Names}}' | grep <service-name>` on the server
4. **Verify DNS resolves:** `dig <subdomain>.programaincluir.org` — must return `<your-server-ip>`

If any check fails, report back to the builder before proceeding.

## 7. Safety Tiers (Dokploy Operations)

| Tier | Operations | Rule |
|------|-----------|------|
| **Read-only** | project-list, inventory, compose-info, compose-search | Run freely |
| **Operational** | compose-deploy, compose-redeploy, compose-stop, compose-start, app-create, project-create | Ask operator first |
| **PROHIBITED** | compose-delete, app-delete, project-delete, database-delete | Never. No exceptions. |

---

## 8. Post-Deploy Verification

After every deploy, Peppy confirms:

1. `curl -I https://<subdomain>.programaincluir.org` returns HTTP/2 200
2. SSL cert is valid (issued by Let's Encrypt)
3. HTTP→HTTPS redirect works (308)
4. Container is running: `docker ps | grep <service-name>`

Report format:
```
**Deploy Complete:**
- URL: https://<subdomain>.programaincluir.org
- Status: HTTP/2 200
- SSL: Let's Encrypt, valid until <date>
- Container: <service-name> running
- Compose ID: <dokploy-compose-id>
```

## 9. Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| 502 Bad Gateway | Port mismatch | Check container listen port vs Dokploy domain port |
| SSL error | Cert not provisioned yet | Wait 30s, Traefik auto-provisions via HTTP-01 |
| "Could not find remote branch" | Wrong branch name | Verify with `git ls-remote`, push to `main` |
| Container name conflict | Missing hash suffix | Rename service with `<name>-<6hex>` pattern |
| Domain not resolving | DNS not propagated | Check `dig <domain>`, wait for propagation |
| Dokploy serviceName mismatch | Service key ≠ domain config | serviceName must match exact key in docker-compose.yml |
