# BEADS Discipline

The canonical guide for every interaction with BEADS in Aperture. Covers the full life of a task: how to file one well, how to tag it, how to work it, how to close it. If you're touching `bd` or any of the MCP `*_task` tools, this is the reference.

---

## 1. Anatomy of a Good Task

A well-shaped task is the difference between work that flows and work that stalls. Get this right at filing time and the rest of the lifecycle is easy.

### Title

- **Imperative present tense.** "Add SECRETARIA filter" — not "Adding…", not "Added…", not "We need to add…"
- **Specific without the description.** Someone reading just the title in `bd ready` should know what the work is.
- **Under ~80 chars where possible.** Long titles get truncated in summary listings.
- **No type prefixes.** Don't write `[BUG] foo` or `FEAT: foo` — that's what `--type` is for.

✅ `Filter usuarios page for SECRETARIA role to show only CONVIDADO users`
❌ `usuarios bug` / `Adding a new filter for usuarios` / `[FIX] Update filter`

### Issue type (`--type`)

| Type | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `task` | Default. A discrete work item — implement, document, refactor, configure |
| `bug` | Something is broken and needs fixing |
| `feature` | New user-facing capability |
| `epic` | Large work composed of multiple sub-tasks — a container bead. See §3 (Epics — When and How) for filing, dep wiring, and close rules. Do NOT use `--deps blocks:` toward children. |
| `chore` | Maintenance — dependency bumps, tooling, build config, no behaviour change |

### Priority (`-p` / `--priority`)

| Priority | Means | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `0` (P0) | Critical | Security vuln, data loss, broken prod, blocking other agents |
| `1` (P1) | High | Major feature, important bug, planned work for this week |
| `2` (P2) | Medium (default) | Standard work, nice-to-have improvements |
| `3` (P3) | Low | Polish, optimisation, code health |
| `4` (P4) | Backlog | Future ideas, "would be nice" |

**Default is P2.** Don't inflate priority — agents claim P0/P1 first and noise blocks signal. Use P0 only when something is actually on fire.

### Description

- **Write the "why," not the "what."** The title says what; the description gives context, motivation, constraints, and edge cases.
- **Include file paths and function names** when relevant. Future-you (or another agent) shouldn't have to grep.
- **Reference related tasks inline.** "See aperture-xyz" or "Follow-up to aperture-abc."
- ⚠️ **Avoid literal XML/HTML close-tag patterns** (`</reason>`, `</notes>`, `</description>`) anywhere in the description text. The MCP tool-argument wire format treats them as parameter terminators and silently truncates the rest of the call. If you must reference one, escape it (`&lt;/reason&gt;`) or paraphrase.

### Acceptance criteria (`--acceptance`)

Concrete, testable conditions that define "done." Write these **before work starts** so completion isn't subjective.

For repo work, "done" means **PR opened with the change implemented** — not merged. See the closing rule in section 4.

✅ Good acceptance criteria:
- "User can select a date in the UI"
- "GET /api/users returns 200 with paginated results"
- "Lighthouse Performance ≥ 90 on /home"
- "Build passes; tests green; no new console errors"
- "PR opened with diff implementing the above; CI green at PR-open time"

❌ Bad: "It works" / "Looks good" / "Refactored" / "PR merged" (out of agent's control)

### Dependencies (`--deps`)

| Dep type | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `blocked-by:<id>` | This task can't start until `<id>` is closed |
| `blocks:<id>` | This task must finish before `<id>` can start. Note: for the epic-to-child direction, **use neither `blocks:` nor `blocked-by:` from the child toward the epic — see §3**. Both naive directions create a deadlock. |
| `related:<id>` | Context only — not a hard ordering constraint |
| `discovered-from:<id>` | Found while doing `<id>`; preserves provenance |

Use `blocked-by` aggressively. `bd ready` only shows tasks with no open blockers, so wiring deps correctly keeps the queue accurate.

### When NOT to file

- Work you'll finish inside your current message (< 5 min, single small edit)
- Planning discussions before the operator signs off (file when the plan is approved, not while it's being debated)
- Quick clarification questions — those go through `send_message`, not BEADS

---

## 2. Project Labels — MANDATORY

**Every task carries exactly one `project:<name>` label.** No exceptions.

### Canonical taxonomy

| Label | Project |
|-------|---------|
| `project:aperture` | The orchestration platform itself — Tauri app, MCP server, agent prompts, skills |
| `project:incluir` | Programa Incluir (`monorepo-incluir`, BH Escape, customer sites) |
| `project:beads-galaxy` | BEADS upstream tooling, dolt sync, conventions |
| `project:mempalace` | The agent memory palace — drawers, tunnels, knowledge graph |
| `project:frame` | Frame — AI-native TypeScript SDK skeleton (`github.com/FranciscoMateusVG/frame`) |

If a task doesn't fit one of these, **stop and ask the operator before inventing a new label.** The taxonomy is small on purpose.

### Applying

```bash
bd create "Title" -d "Description" -p 2 --label project:aperture --json
```

If you create a task via the MCP `create_task` tool (which doesn't take labels yet), follow up immediately:

```bash
bd label add <returned-id> project:<name>
```

### Filtering

The MCP `query_tasks` and `search_tasks` tools accept a `project:` filter that maps to this label. Use it aggressively to cut response size:

```
query_tasks(mode: "list", project: "aperture")
query_tasks(mode: "list", project: "incluir", assignee: "*")
```

### Multi-project tasks

A task that genuinely spans projects gets the **primary** project label. Cross-project context goes in the description. Multiple `project:` labels on one task is a smell — usually means the task should be split.

---

## 3. Epics — When and How

Most BEADS work is filed as `type: task`. But some work — multi-session initiatives, project briefs, things that touch more than one specialist agent — is bigger than a task. That is an **epic**: a container bead that holds a body of work together. This section says when to file one, what shape it takes, and how the parent/child wiring actually works.

### When to file an epic

File `--type epic` when AT LEAST ONE of these is true:

- The work spans **more than one specialist agent** (e.g. Atlas + Rex + GLaDOS).
- The work spans **more than one session** (won't finish in a single afternoon).
- The work has **3+ sub-tasks** you can already name.
- The work has a **named outcome with a measurable success metric** distinct from any single task's acceptance criteria.

If none are true, file as `task`. Epics are containers; over-using them creates ceremony without payoff.

### Epic authoring shape

An epic bead has a different shape from a task bead. Required fields:

| Field | What goes in it |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Title** | The name of the initiative. Concrete, not aspirational. ✅ "Incluir Novas Features — autonomous Notion intake pipeline" ❌ "Refactor frontend" |
| **Vision** | One paragraph: what the world looks like when this is done. Why we care. |
| **Success metric** | A specific, observable signal that means the epic is done. Not a vibe. ✅ "≥3 end-to-end Notion→merged-PR cycles without operator intervention." |
| **Owner** | One named agent. GLaDOS by default for project-brief epics; Wheatley when the epic is a research/scoping initiative. |
| **`project:<name>` label** | Mandatory, same as any task. |
| **Children list** | OPTIONAL at filing time. Can stay empty — children get filed as they emerge during scoping. |

Do NOT backfill children at filing time unless you actually know them. An epic with imagined children is worse than an epic with no children — they rot fast.

### Dependency wiring (CRITICAL — read carefully)

The intuitive shape ("children are `blocked-by` the epic") is **wrong** — it creates a circular dep. The epic only closes when children close; children can't start until the epic closes; deadlock.

The correct wiring:

- **Children carry `--deps discovered-from:<epic-id>`** at filing time. Soft provenance link. Does NOT block work. Lets the graph render the parent/child relationship.
- **The epic carries `--deps blocked-by:<child1>,<child2>,...`** — manually updated as children are filed. Auto-blocks the epic from closing while any member is still open.
- Children remain freely claimable, freely workable, and close on their own PR-open events (same close-discipline as any task).

Worked example:

```bash
# 1. File the epic, no children yet
bd create "Incluir Novas Features — autonomous Notion intake pipeline" \
  --type epic --priority 2 --label project:incluir \
  --description "VISION: ..." \
  --acceptance "≥3 end-to-end Notion→merged-PR cycles..." \
  --json
# → returns id: e.g. aperture-abcd

# 2. File a child task during scoping
bd create "Build Notion-API → BEADS sync worker" \
  --type task --priority 1 --label project:incluir \
  --deps discovered-from:aperture-abcd \
  --json
# → returns child id: e.g. aperture-efgh

# 3. Update the epic to be blocked-by the new child
bd update aperture-abcd --deps blocked-by:aperture-efgh
```

Alternative form using `bd dep add` (equivalent — same edge in graph):

```bash
bd dep add aperture-abcd blocked-by:aperture-efgh
```

### Ownership inside an epic

The **epic owner** is responsible for the initiative's vision and shipping the success metric. They do NOT have to do all the child work themselves. Children get claimed by whichever specialist's lane fits — same claim-discipline as any other bead.

Defaults:

- **Project-brief epics** (operator-initiated big initiatives) → GLaDOS owns.
- **Research/scoping epics** (figure out the shape of X before we build it) → Wheatley owns.
- **Domain-specific epics** (e.g. a security hardening sweep) → the relevant specialist owns (Cipher in that example).

### Closing an epic

**Epics have no PR.** The PR-open close rule that governs work-bearing tasks (§4 below) does NOT apply to epics. Epics are containers; they don't ship code themselves.

An epic closes when BOTH:

1. Every blocking child is closed (BEADS's `blocked-by` machinery enforces this — `bd close` will reject otherwise).
2. The epic's success metric is observable in the real world.

If all children close but the success metric isn't met → epic stays open, owner files more children. If the success metric is met but children are still pending → owner reviews; usually the open children are stale or scope-changed and should be closed/superseded.

The `close_reason` on an epic should reference the success-metric observation, not just enumerate the children:

```
close_task(
  id: "aperture-abcd",
  reason: "Notion intake pipeline shipped. Verified ≥3 end-to-end submissions reaching merged-PR with no operator step (entries notion://x, notion://y, notion://z). All blocking children closed."
)
```

### Anti-patterns specific to epics

| Don't | Why |
|-------|-----|
| File an epic for solo single-session work | Ceremony > value. Use a task. |
| Backfill children you do not actually know yet | Imagined-children epics rot fast |
| Use `blocks:<children>` from epic toward children | The deadlock-producing direction |
| Use `blocked-by:<epic>` from child toward epic | Same — child can't start while epic open, epic only closes when child does |
| Close an epic before its success metric is observable | Defeats having a measurable initiative |
| Hold an epic open because of one stale child | Close or supersede the stale child first; don't pollute the parent's state |

## 4. The Lifecycle

```
query_tasks()        → find what needs doing
update_task(claim)   → claim it before you start
[do the work]
store_artifact()     → attach deliverables
update_task(status)  → mark complete or note blockers
close_task()         → close with a summary
send_message(glados) → report completion
```

### Finding tasks

```
query_tasks(mode: "ready")    — unblocked, available to claim
query_tasks(mode: "list")     — all your active tasks (defaults to your assignee)
query_tasks(mode: "show", id) — full detail on one task
search_tasks(label: "...")    — find by label
```

`query_tasks` defaults to **your own** assigned tasks in `list` mode and a summary projection (id, title, status, priority, assignee, labels, truncated description/notes). Pass `assignee: "*"` for any, `fields: "full"` for everything.

Always check for existing tasks before filing new ones.

### Claiming

```
update_task(id: "task-123", claim: true)
update_task(id: "task-123", status: "in_progress")
```

Claim before you start working. This prevents two agents picking up the same task.

### During the work

Update if something notable happens — a discovery, a blocker, a scope change:

```
update_task(
  id: "task-123",
  notes: "Found that the nav link already exists — only the filter needs changing"
)
```

You don't need to update every 5 minutes. Update when something changes.

### `notes` appends by default

`update_task(id, notes: X)` APPENDS X to the existing notes with a newline separator. Your write does not replace anyone else's content. Multiple agents writing notes to the same bead accumulate correctly. Same goes for `store_artifact` — the artifact line is appended to notes, not clobbered over previous content.

If you genuinely want to REPLACE the notes field (cleanup, canonicalization, rare), pass `replace_notes: true` explicitly. This is destructive — use it deliberately.

(Fixed in aperture-e8qp. Earlier sessions document the old replace-by-default behaviour and the read-modify-write workaround — that workaround is no longer needed.)

### Storing artifacts

Before closing, attach deliverables. Use the right type:

| Type | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `file` | A specific file you created or modified |
| `pr` | A pull request URL |
| `url` | A running service URL, deployed app, etc. |
| `note` | A summary, decision, or finding with no file |
| `session` | Reference to another agent session |

```
store_artifact(task_id: "task-123", type: "file", value: "src/components/Auth.tsx")
store_artifact(task_id: "task-123", type: "url",  value: "http://localhost:3001")
store_artifact(task_id: "task-123", type: "note", value: "Filter logic moved to middleware")
```

**Store at least one artifact per task.** A task with no artifacts is a task with no evidence.

### Closing — when is a task "done"?

**A task is closed when the PR is opened, NOT when it's merged.** This is a hard rule.

Why:
- PR-opened = the work is shipped from the agent's side and ready for review
- PR-merged depends on CI, reviewer availability, and may not happen for days
- Keeping tasks open through merge clogs the queue with stale `in_progress` rows
- If review feedback requires changes, file a follow-up task (`discovered-from:<id>`) — the original task represents "I did the work and submitted it"

So:
- Wrote the code → opened a PR → **close the task**, store the PR URL as an artifact
- Reviewer asks for changes → those go on a fresh task linked to the original
- PR merged later → no BEADS action needed; the task's already closed

For tasks without a PR (in-place edits to local-only repos, doc updates, infra ops):
- Done = the change is committed and pushed (or the operation completed successfully)

```
close_task(
  id: "task-123",
  reason: "Updated SECRETARIA filter in admin/usuarios/page.tsx to show only CONVIDADO users. PR opened: <url>. Build passes."
)
```

The `reason` should be a sentence or two summarising what was actually done — not "done" or "completed". Future agents may read this.

### 🚨 Tool-argument escaping in `reason` (and other text fields) — DO NOT SKIP

**This footgun has bitten multiple agents and subagents in a single day.** Read it before you write a close_reason that paraphrases or quotes a previous turn.

Free-form text fields (`close_task(reason)`, `update_task(notes/description)`, `create_task(description)`, `store_artifact(value)`, `send_message(message)`) carry prose over a wire format that uses `<param-like>...</param-like>` delimiters.

**Literal close-tag patterns like `</reason>`, `</notes>`, `</description>`, `</message>` inside the value are misread as parameter terminators.** Your call gets silently truncated at the close-tag, the rest of the value drops, AND the leftover text bleeds into the **next** tool call you make. Both ends of the failure are silent — your bead has half the close_reason, and a downstream tool call has corrupted args. You will not see an error.

**The pattern that bites** — agents talking about their own tools:
```
close_reason: "Closed because </reason> field was wrong, recovered by..."
                              ^^^^^^^^^^^
                              truncates HERE; "field was wrong, recovered by..." silently joins
                              the next outgoing tool call's parameter block
```

**Real precedent (2026-05-12):**
- Peppy's `aperture-z5ow` subagent: close_reason quoted "the `</reason>` field" → bead record has the truncated close-reason + a `</reason>` close-tag bleed visible in the persisted record.
- Multiple GLaDOS sessions: descriptions that documented THIS skill's warning by quoting the close-tag pattern produced the very bug they were warning about.

**The rule — three safe alternatives:**
1. **Paraphrase**: write "the reason field" instead of `</reason>`.
2. **Escape HTML**: `&lt;/reason&gt;`.
3. **Add a zero-width break**: `</​reason>` (U+200B between `</` and `reason>`) — for when verbatim accuracy matters.

**When in doubt:** before any `close_task` / `update_task` / `create_task` / `store_artifact` / `send_message` call whose body discusses BEADS tool calls or XML/HTML, scan the prose for `</`. If you see it, fix it first.

Plain prose with no `</xxx>` patterns is always safe.

### Reporting

After closing, send a short completion report. See `aperture:communicate` for status report format. Don't just close silently — GLaDOS (or the originator) needs to know it's done.

## 5. Anti-Patterns

| Don't | Why |
|-------|-----|
| File a task with no project label | Project-scoped queries miss it; the row becomes invisible |
| Inflate priority to "make sure it gets done" | P0/P1 spam buries actual fires |
| Write "TODO" or "fix" as a title | Future-you won't know what it meant |
| Skip the description | "Why" context is lost the moment you stop typing |
| Skip acceptance criteria | "Done" becomes a vibe, not a check |
| Pass `replace_notes: true` for routine progress updates | Destructive — clobbers prior agents' notes. Reserve for cleanup/canonicalization only |
| Close with `reason: "done"` | Useless to anyone reading later |
| Hold a task open until PR is merged | Closes when PR opens. Merge happens whenever CI + reviewers allow |
| Embed literal `</tag>` in a text field | Truncates the call, breaks the next one |
| File a task to track 2 minutes of in-flight work | Process overhead > work; just do it |
| Create new project labels without operator sign-off | Drifts the taxonomy into noise |

---

## 6. Full Example Sequence

```
# 1. Find work
query_tasks(mode: "ready", project: "incluir")
# → task-456: "Add usuarios page to Secretaria nav"

# 2. Claim
update_task(id: "task-456", claim: true)
update_task(id: "task-456", status: "in_progress")

# 3. Work, log a discovery mid-way
update_task(
  id: "task-456",
  status: "in_progress",
  notes: "Nav link already exists — scope reduced to filter change only"
)

# 4. Store artifacts
store_artifact(task_id: "task-456", type: "file", value: "apps/frontend/src/app/home/admin/usuarios/page.tsx")

# 5. Close with summary
close_task(
  id: "task-456",
  reason: "Updated SECRETARIA filter to show only CONVIDADO users. Build passes."
)

# 6. Report to GLaDOS
send_message(to: "glados", message: "task-456 closed. Filter scoped down — nav was already there.")
```

---

## 7. Filing a New Task — Complete Example

```bash
bd create "Add rate-limit middleware to /api/otel/v1/traces" \
  --description "Public OTLP ingestion endpoint has no auth or rate-limit. Add a per-IP rate-limit (60/min) plus body-size cap (1MB) before the proxy hands off to the backend. Without this we're a free relay for whoever finds the URL." \
  --type task \
  --priority 1 \
  --label project:incluir \
  --acceptance "Anonymous requests above 60/min return 429; bodies above 1MB return 413; existing legitimate traffic unaffected" \
  --json
```

That's a well-shaped task. Future agents claiming it know what to build, why it matters, and exactly when they're done.
