description: Git worktree convention for any agent editing a shared repo. Use when claiming a task that involves code changes — monorepo-incluir, aperture itself, beads-galaxy, or any other repo where multiple agents may work concurrently. Triggers on task claims that involve editing a shared codebase.

# Worktree Discipline

When any agent edits a shared repo, they use **per-task git worktrees** to avoid stepping on each other's branches and uncommitted state. Vance has been doing this from day one and it's our gold-standard pattern; the rule is now general.

---

## 1. The Convention

For any task that requires editing the shared monorepo:

```
~/projects/monorepo-incluir-worktrees/<task-id>-<slug>
```

Examples:
- `~/projects/monorepo-incluir-worktrees/aperture-fict-mariana-forum-fix`
- `~/projects/monorepo-incluir-worktrees/incluir-bl9p-secretaria-filter`
- `~/projects/monorepo-incluir-worktrees/aperture-3kx2-auth-rewrite`

**Slug rules:** lowercase, kebab-case, 2–5 words describing the task. Long enough to identify, short enough to type.

**Branch name** matches the directory: `<task-id>-<slug>`.

---

## 2. Setting Up a Worktree

When you claim a task that needs code changes:

```bash
cd ~/projects/monorepo-incluir
git fetch
git worktree add -b <task-id>-<slug> ../monorepo-incluir-worktrees/<task-id>-<slug> origin/main
cd ../monorepo-incluir-worktrees/<task-id>-<slug>
```

Now you have an isolated working tree on a fresh branch from `origin/main`. Edit, commit, and push from this directory. Never edit the main checkout while another agent might be using it.

---

## 3. Cleanup On Close

When the task is closed (merged, abandoned, or otherwise complete):

```bash
cd ~/projects/monorepo-incluir
git worktree remove ../monorepo-incluir-worktrees/<task-id>-<slug>
git branch -D <task-id>-<slug>  # only if branch was merged or abandoned
```

If the branch was merged via PR, the remote tracking branch is gone after the PR closes — `git fetch --prune` cleans that up.

**This step is mandatory.** Stale worktrees accumulate disk and pollute `git worktree list`. If you close a BEADS task, your worktree should be gone within the same session.

---

## 4. Which Agents

**Every agent that edits a shared repo follows this convention.** No exceptions, no "I'll just do this small one in main." That's how state leaks happen.

Typical edit-bearing agents and what they touch:

- **GLaDOS** — direct edits when not delegating
- **Wheatley** — small scoped implementations delegated by GLaDOS
- **Peppy** — Dockerfiles, compose, CI configs
- **Rex** — backend code, migrations
- **Izzy** — test files, bug repros
- **Cipher** — security patches
- **Vance** — frontend / CSS (gold standard, already doing this)
- **Scout** — mobile code
- **Atlas** — README/docs in shared repos
- **Sage** — copy/content in shared repos
- **Sterling** — when reviewing requires checking out a branch locally

If your turn involves `git checkout` or any file edit in a shared repo, you make a worktree first.

---

## 5. Anti-Patterns

| Don't | Why |
|---|---|
| Edit `~/projects/monorepo-incluir/` directly | Conflicts with whatever another agent is doing on `main` |
| Reuse a worktree across tasks | Branch state leaks between unrelated work |
| Skip the slug, use only the task ID | `aperture-2yho` tells nobody anything; `aperture-2yho-rate-limiter` is searchable |
| Leave dead worktrees lying around | `git worktree list` becomes noise; disk fills up |
| Push directly to `main` from a worktree | Worktrees are for branch work. PRs go through review. |

---

## 6. Hygiene Audit

GLaDOS spot-checks worktree hygiene on a rolling basis:

- `ls ~/projects/<repo>-worktrees/` should match open BEADS tasks claimed by editing agents
- Closed tasks with surviving worktrees → flag the owning agent
- Worktrees with no corresponding BEADS task → flag for cleanup

Light-touch enforcement, not a witch hunt. The goal is to keep shared repos clean and predictable.

---

## 7. Other Repos

This skill is written for `monorepo-incluir`. The same pattern applies if you're working concurrently in any shared repo — adapt the path:

```
~/projects/<repo>-worktrees/<task-id>-<slug>
```

Aperture itself, beads-galaxy, mempalace — same rule, same hygiene.

---

## 8. Stacked PRs — when your worktree's branch depends on another open PR

Sometimes your work genuinely depends on a parent PR that hasn't merged yet (e.g. Vance's frontend digest UI needs Rex's backend digest column to land first). When that happens, you might be tempted to open your PR with `--base <parent-branch>` instead of `--base main`. **Don't, unless you understand the auto-close failure mode.**

When the parent merges via the auto-merge workflow on `monorepo-incluir`, `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch` deletes the parent's head branch. Three seconds later, GitHub auto-closes your dependent PR because its base no longer exists. Your code stays on the worktree's branch (nothing's lost from disk), but the PR ceremony evaporates and recovery requires opening a fresh PR — `gh pr edit --base main` and `gh pr reopen` both fail in that order.

**Prevention:** prefer `--base main` for your PR. If your work doesn't typecheck or test against current main, reconsider whether you should be opening the PR yet — wait until the parent merges, then rebase onto fresh main and open.

**If you genuinely must stack:** retarget to main as soon as the parent's CI is green and merge is imminent, BEFORE the parent merges:

```bash
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main
git push --force-with-lease origin <your-branch>
gh pr edit <your-pr-num> --base main
```

**Recovery procedure (after auto-close):** see `aperture:incluir-deploy` Gotcha #9 for the full fresh-PR + cross-link-comment procedure. Banked precedents: PR #237→#245 (Vance, 2026-05-14), PR #242→#244 (Rex, 2026-05-14).

Worktree itself stays alive through the recovery — same branch, same files. You're only re-opening the GitHub PR surface, not the local work.
